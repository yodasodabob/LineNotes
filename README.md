This repository contains tools to help theatre Stage Managers create and distribute line notes.

## Current Status
This repository currently serves as the github pages location for the code for SMHub and the storage location for linenotes2.py and linenotes3.py.  By early 2018, the hosting location for SMHub is going to be changed and will no longer be hosted on this repository. Eventually, this repository will serve as the main hosting location for linenotes2.py, linenotes3.py, and ScriptTools.js for public use.

## History
Spring 2017: linenotes2 is created in python by and to assist the stage manager of Earlham College's production of Acid Dolphin Experiment.

Summer 2017: Work begins on SMHub, a react-based web-client in Javascript, to make distribution and creation of line notes much easier.

Fall 2018: SMHub is implemented and used in Earlham's production of She Kills Monsters to great success.  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
